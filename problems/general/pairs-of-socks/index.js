/**
  Suppose you have a bunch of socks, each of which is one (and only one) color, and you want to sell the matching pairs.
  Write a function that takes an array of integers representing the color of each sock and returns the number of matching pairs.
  So, for example, if I send in [1,10,25,25,10,25], I should expect to get back 2 because only 10 and 25 have matches;
  perhaps the dryer ate the lost socks for 1 and the third 25!
